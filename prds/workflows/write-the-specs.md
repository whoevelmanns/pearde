# write-the-specs — units another worker can finish

## Do

1. One `prds/<prd>/specs/specNN.md` per implementable unit, from
   @references/templates/spec.md.
2. Frontmatter carries `complexity:` and `footprint:`. The footprints across
   the specs are what the overlap check reads, so a path in two specs is a
   decision, not an accident.
3. Every acceptance box names an output a check can read. Write the box
   spelling inside backticks in any prose about it — the matcher is
   line-based and fence-blind, so a pasted open box becomes a real one.
4. Give each spec a `## Verify and Proof` block whose every command names a
   path from that spec's own `footprint:`. Never the whole workspace. There is
   no `verify:` frontmatter key — the template's keys are a closed set.
5. Say in each spec what already stands from the build and what is left.
6. `grep -c '^- \[ \]' prds/<prd>/specs/*.md` — every spec has at least one
   box, and none is ticked before an implementer runs it. Then
   `awk '/^```/{f=!f;next} f' prds/<prd>/specs/*.md` and read every command
   back: each must name a path from its own spec's `footprint:`.

## Done when

- Every spec has `complexity:`, `footprint:`, acceptance boxes and a
  `## Verify and Proof` block.
- No box asks for a commit message — committing is not the implementer's act.
- No command in any block runs the whole workspace.
- Each spec states what the probe already left in the tree.
