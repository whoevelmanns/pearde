# Drilldown

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding.  
Record this as a **prd tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.  

Work the prds in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites  
are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you  
haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give  
your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
Question *Q1*: **<question title>**:
<question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

Recommendation <your recommended answer>

---

Question *Q2*: **<question title>**:
<question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

Recommendation <your recommended answer>

...

```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier  
outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask  
the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in  
this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.  

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a  
fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a worker to find it;  
don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself.  
Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the  
questions downstream of it wait for the worker to report; ask the rest of the  
frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree  
visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms  
you have reached a shared understanding.

The tree you record is the board's own shape (see the skill's `README.md`): one directory
per decision holding a `prd.md`, the decisions hanging off it as subdirectories
with their own. Write it there — settled contract in the body, `state: open` —
and the loop takes it from there.
